The Idea

Poetr (poet - er) is a space for the exploration and creation of poetry. Readers are presented with a poem that may seem random... or perhaps it's a step on their unique path through the collection. They may continue their journey via one of two buttons: one to dive deeper down the path they're on, and one to shift to a new perspective. If the inspiration strikes them, a reader may submit their own piece, saved in its unique spot in the collection yet tied to poems with a similar vibe.
How We Made It

The Poetr team divided our project into a front-end and back-end, and collaborated by using Github to coordinate remote coding. The back end is built on Django, a versatile web platform for Python. We utilized Django's built-in support for the common Model-View-Controller design pattern, which allowed for fast and flexible storage of the poem's in Django's database. Django's Views module helped package the data for use with the HTML files, which our front end team designed and styled with CSS.

Team Testimonials

Alice:

Jett: I worked on the back-end with Alice. Together, we wrote the python code that manages and presents our data. I also worked a bit with the front end team; I created our logo graphic in Adobe Illustrator and revised it with feedback from Nicolas and Mike.

Mike: Contributing to the front end of our project has really helped me hone my responsive layout and best practice skills. Designing quickly while maintaining proper HTML and CSS standards was fun and ensured the project developed smoothly. Working with Nicolas on front end also helped us collaborate together and help each other through the process.

    utilizing a responsive design

Team Testimonials

Alice:

Jett: Learning the syntax and structure of Django was the largest challenge I faced, but now that I'm familiar with it I'm excited to add a powerful tool to my belt.

Mike: Personally, I found it a challenge to incorporate a responsive design and making sure the layouts adapted to the most used browsers and devices in a 24 hour period. Another point I wasn't quite sure how to do was connecting the front end to the back. With Alice's and Jett's help, we were able to figure out the Django syntax.

Nicolas:
Accomplishments We Are Proud Of

We are proud of developing a Django based web application that provides a space for the exploration of poetry. We worked together as a team to brainstorm new ideas, implement new features, and solve problems at every level.

Alice:

Jett: I'm proud of the report feature, as I worked on a lot of the code for it and I believe it's essential to maintaining a safe and welcoming space.

Mike: I am really proud that our team was able to accomplish a fairly beautiful project in a short amount of time. With a first time experience at a hackathon, it was great to see how efficiently our group formed and collaborated. Really proud of the work that we did overall.
